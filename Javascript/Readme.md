# Topics Covered 

## 1 - JavaScript Syntax and Operators
#### Topics:
    1-Switch Statement
        - strict comparision
        - block level issue 
    2-for/in and for/of
        - for/in : > iterate over element of object (properties and methods)
                   > return key (property / method) name 
                   > object[key] return value
        -for/off : > iterates over values in array , string , etc
                   > return object for each iteration
        - break and continue statement
        - labeled statement
            goto a location of goto - > Note : dont recommended use of lables as this leads to spaghetti code
    3-Math, Comparison , and logical operators
        - operators(+,-,/,*,%,++,--**)
        - plus sign with Strings and Number
        - Math
        - Assignment operator(=,+=,-=,%=,/=,*=,**=)
        - Comparison
            1) > Greater than   2) < less than  3) >= Greater than or equall
            **4) == Equal in value    5) === Equall in value and type**
        - 'use strict' functionality
            > YOur should always being using 
            > ignore  by older browser 
            > force all variable to be decluare
            > Mistyped variable names are created globally scoped
            > Some rules
                - can't use reserved words as  a variable
                - can't delete variable
                - can't deleter function
    4- working with Logical operators and short-circuit Evaluation
        - Truthy and Falsy
            > Any Variable with a value ("nazeer" ,10 ) or Boolean true is true
            > Any variable = false, null , undefined ,NaN, "" is false
        - Logical Operators (&& , || , !)
        - Short Circuiting
            > Optimization for logical expression
            > By passsing subsequent expression in && or || based on truthy and falsy
        - operator precedence
            1) Grouping (())
            2) Not (!)
            3) Multiplication (*)
            4) Division (/)
            5) Modules (%
            6) Addition (+)
            7) Substraction (-)
            8) less than (<)
            9) less than or equall (<=)
            10) Greater than (>)
            11) Greater than or equall (>=)
            12) Equall (=)
            13) Not equal (!=)
            14) Strict equall (===)
            15) strict not equall (!==)
            15) And (&&)
            16) or (||)
            17) Assignment
    4-Exceptions , error types , data types
    5-this keyword
    6-Spread operator
