## How Does Internet Work ?
     >The Internet is a computer network that interconnects hundreds of millions of computing devices throughout the world. Not too 
     long ago, these computing devices were primarily traditional desktop PCs, Linux workstations, and so-called servers that store and
     transmit information such as Web pages and e-mail messages. Increasingly,  however, nontraditional Internet end systems such as 
     laptops, smartphones, tablets, TVs, gaming consoles, Web cams, automobiles, environmental sensing devices,  picture frames, and 
     home electrical and security systems are being connected to the Internet. Indeed, the term computer network is beginning to sound 
     a bit dated, given  the many nontraditional devices that are being hooked up to the Internet. In Internet jargon, all of these 
     devices are called hosts or end systems. As of July 2011, there were nearly 850 million end systems attached to the Internet [ISC 
     2012], not counting smartphones, laptops, and other devices that are only intermittently connected to the Internet. Overall, more 
     there are an estimated 2 billion Internet users [ITU 2011].End systems are connected together by a network of communication links 
     and packet switches. We’ll see in Section 1.2 that there are many types of communication links, which are made up of different 
     types of physical media, including coaxial cable, copper wire, optical fiber, and radio spectrum. Different links can transmit 
     data at different rates, with the transmission rate of a link measured in bits/second. When one end system has data to send to 
     another end system, the sending end system segments the data and adds header bytes to each segment. The resulting packages of 
     information, known as packets in the jargon of computer networks, are then sent through the network to the destination end system, 
     where they are reassembled into the original data. A packet switch takes a packet arriving on one of its incoming communication 
     links and forwards that packet on one of its outgoing communication links. Packet switches come in many shapes and flavors, but 
     the two most prominent types in today’s Internet are routers and link-layer switches. Both types of switches forward packets 
     toward their ultimate destinations. Link-layer switches are typically used in access networks, while routers are typically used in 
     the network core. The sequence of communication links and packet switches traversed by a packet from the sending end system to the 
     receiving end system is known as a route or path through the network. The exact amount of traffic being carried in the Internet is 
     difficult to estimate but Cisco [Cisco VNI 2011] estimates global Internet traffic will be nearly 40 exabytes per month in 2012. 
     Packet-switched networks (which transport packets) are in many ways similar to transportation networks of highways, roads, and 
     intersections (which transport vehicles). Consider, for example, a factory that needs to move a large amount of cargo to some 
     destination warehouse located thousands of kilometers away. At the factory, the cargo is segmented and loaded into a fleet of 
     trucks. Each of the trucks then independently travels through the network of highways, roads, and intersections to the destination 
     warehouse. At the destination warehouse, the cargo is unloaded and grouped with the rest of the cargo arriving from the same 
     shipment. Thus, in many ways, packets are analogous to trucks, communication links are analogous to highways and roads, packet 
     switches are analogous to intersections, and end systems are analogous to buildings. Just as a truck takes a path through the 
     transportation network, a packet takes a path through a computer network. End systems access the Internet through Internet Service 
     Providers (ISPs), including residential ISPs such as local cable or telephone companies; corporate ISPs; university ISPs; and ISPs 
     that provide WiFi access in airports, hotels, coffee shops, and other public places. Each ISP is in itself a network of packet 
     switches and communication links. ISPs provide a variety of types of network access to the end systems, including residential 
     broadband access such as cable modem or DSL, high-speed local area network access, wireless access, and 56 kbps dial-up modem 
     access. ISPs also provide Internet access to content providers, connecting Web sites directly to the Internet. The Internet is all 
     about connecting end systems to each other, so the ISPs that provide access to end systems must also be interconnected. These 
     lower-tier ISPs are interconnected through national and international upper-tier ISPs such as Level 3 Communications, AT&T, 
     Sprint, and NTT. An upper-tier ISP consists of high-speed routers interconnected with high-speed fiber-optic links. Each ISP 
     network, whether upper-tier or lower-tier, is managed independently, runs the IP protocol (see below), and conforms to certain 
     naming and address conventions. We’ll examine ISPs and their interconnection more closely in Section 1.3. End systems, packet 
     switches, and other pieces of the Internet run protocols that control the sending and receiving of information within the 
     Internet. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP) are two of the most important protocols in the 
     Internet. The IP protocol specifies the format of the packets that are sent and received among routers and end systems. The 
     Internet’s principal protocols are collectively known as TCP/IP. We’ll begin looking into protocols in this introductory chapter. 
     But that’s just a start—much of this book is concerned with computer network protocols! Given the importance of protocols to the 
     Internet, it’s important that everyone agree on what each and every protocol does, so that people can create systems and products 
     that interoperate. This is where standards come into play. Internet standards are developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force 
     (IETF)[IETF 2012]. The IETF standards documents are called requests for comments (RFCs). RFCs started out as general requests for 
     comments (hence the name) to resolve network snd protocol design problems that faced the precursor to the Internet [Allman 2011]. 
     RFCs tend to be quite technical and detailed. They define protocols such as TCP, IP, HTTP (for the Web), and SMTP (for e-mail). 
     There are currently more than 6,000 RFCs. Other bodies also specify standards for network components, most notably for network 
     links. The IEEE 802 LAN/MAN Standards Committee [IEEE 802 2012], for example, specifies the Ethernet and wireless WiFi standards
